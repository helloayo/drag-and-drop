	<p class="answer">The most critical problem is that you have scared, angry customers trapped in cars high on the coaster’s tracks. You should give customers both on the ride and standing in the line constant updates about what is really a minor problem and when it will be fixed. Reassure everyone that there is no danger to the people trapped on the ride</p>
	<p class="feedback"><span>Great decision!</span> You’ve identified correctly the most critical problem. You’ve done a good job gathering key evidence, such as the breakdown is caused by a sensor that can be fixed within 10 minutes, customers on the ride need to be communicated with, as do customers waiting in line that are angry and concerned about why the ride is broken. The customers affected most need to be taken care of first.</p>

	<p class="answer">The most critical problem is that you have angry customers standing in line that are nervous about getting on the roller coaster. You should have a park representative apologize to them and assure them that their safety is the park’s first priority. The park rep should explain that someone is coming to help the people trapped on the ride. Customers waiting in line should get a voucher for a free lunch.</p>
	<p class="feedback"> <span>Not too bad.</span> You’ve done a good job gathering key evidence, such as the breakdown is caused by a sensor that can be fixed within 10 minutes, and customers on the ride need to be communicated with, as do customers waiting in line that are angry and concerned about why the ride is broken However, the customers affected most need to be taken care of first </p>

	<p>The most critical problem is that customers at the Chaotic Canyon ride are very angry, which could really hurt the park’s profitability for the day and, if not resolved quickly, could significantly impact future revenue. You should have a park representative apologize to customers for the inconvenience and offer to refund the cost of their tickets.</p>
	<p class="feedback"><span>Oops!</span> It doesn’t seem like you weighed all the evidence before deciding on the most immediate problem that should be addressed. Safety and communication must come first when you have a situation like this. You may not have considered what happens to the financial health of the park when you give customers their money back every time they’re unhappy. Next time you’re faced with a difficult situation, make sure you use the five-step, problem-solving model to figure it out.</p>

	<p>The most critical problem is that local news reporters are at the park to cover an upcoming concert. They would love to get the scoop that frantic people are stuck on the roller coaster. A story like this could turn into a public relations fiasco. You should alert the park’s public relations people to prepare to a toned-down message to deliver to the public. Then try to distract the reporters so they aren’t aware of the trapped customers.</p>
	<p class="feedback"><span>Not a good choice.</span> Your top priority should be the safety of and communication with your customers, not dodging public reaction to a potentially negative park incident. Next time you’re faced with a difficult situation, make sure you use the five-step, problem-solving model to figure it out.</p>
